# kotlin-android
Sample Android app in Kotlin.  This is a simple "guessing game" inspired by the vulgar number guessing app we used to share on our TI-8x calculators in high school.  This one is much less abusive and uses standard Android widgets for a messaging-style experience.

# Running
Your best bet will be importing the project into [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).  Getting an Android development environment set up is a bit of an elaborate process that the unititated should Google.  That said, this app is "optimized" to run on Android 9 (aka "Pie" or API 28).
